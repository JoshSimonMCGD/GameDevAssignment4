This Game is an interactive audio mixer. The player's objective is to simply click on the various 'Gems' and 'Nodes' to create a musical beat. The mouse moves the arm to click the nodes. One click on a node will illuminate the 'Node', and will play the sound looped until it is clicked again.

NOTE 1: Each sound is 16 beats long at a 120 beats per minute. 4 Bars of 4 beats. 

THEREFORE: After clicking a sound, it will take till the end of the 4th bar to start playing. Meaning, the first sound will take 4 bars (16 beats) to start playing.


The best way to play the game the first time would be to click on each button one at a time, and wait for the 16 beats at 120 bpm (8 seconds) for the sound to start playing, then add another 1 by 1.

NOTE 2: A sound will also take till the end of the 4 bars to turn off. The game will be updated to turn sounds off right away.

NOTE 3: If a button is spammed on and off, it's state can get confused. This issue will hopefully be fixed when the 'instant sound off' update is added.
